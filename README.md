# Basic RPG
This project is a "rpg" style game where the player must figure out 
which opponents to fight first to increase their power, and which ones
to save for later when you are powerful enough.

#### To play
  Simply load the web page and follow the instructions. Each character has a slightly different attack, counterattack, and HP attribute. First, select a character and an initial opponent. Then, attack! The players HP will decrease by the opponents counter attack value, while the opponents HP will decrease by the player's attack. After each attack, the player's attack will increase. If you can defeat each opponent before your chosen characters HP falls below zero, you win!
