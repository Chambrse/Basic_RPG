# unit-4-game
Another exciting homework assignment!

This project is a "rpg" style game where the player must figure out 
which opponents to fight first to increase their power, and which ones
to save for later when you are powerful enough.

The main objective of this homework assignment was to experiment with dynamically generated elements. I utilized jQuery to do this a bit easier. I learned a lot about this subject and was able to incorporate these techniques in later projects.
